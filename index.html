 Need for more aid for students with disabilities
  </h1>
  <p>
    It is not fair that students with disabilities are put into classes that are either below their abilities or way too far above. 
   There has to be a middle ground for students to get the help that they need, and this is not being seen in the current educational system. 
   Too often students that do not belong in a general educational classroom are placed in them where they are unable to comprehend the material. 
   While this aids them with their social interactions, it is detrimental for their mental health and education.

  <p>
    The consistent negative feedback on papers and assignments is harmful to students that will never be able to perform better due to their disabilities. 
   The repitition of receiving failing grades and the inability to improve leads the student to associate education with constant failure.
   This barrier is only solved by placing these students in an educational setting that challenges them but provides hope and a vision of success.
